# Inventory Application

This is the repo for the Inventory Application project in the NodeJS course of The Odin Project.  Using MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS the project builds an inventory database for an imaginary store.  The app is to be able to create, read, update, and delete \(CRUD\) items and categories in the store.

## What I Learned

### EJS

I thought switching to EJS would ease my pains with using Pug, but it turns out I forgot most of the EJS syntax and the documents were not much help.  I had to search for answers on how to escape/unescape characters, how to write if-else statements, and how to include other template files.  I think I spent more time figuring out the syntax than I was figuring out how to pass data to be rendered.  And the curly brackets were getting me all confused with the angled brackets.

### MongoDB Shell

I have been forcing myself to use a lot more CLIs \(command line interface\) so I can feel more comfortable in situations where I'm stuck with only a command line.  GUIs \(graphical user interface\) have been a luxury of modern development, but back in the day there was only a prompt and that blinking cursor to look at.  After fixing my issues with MongoDB on WSL \(Windows Subsytem for Linux\), I realized that I didn't have Compass to help display the data.  I resorted to using MongoDB Shell for the first time.  I had done a previous tutorial on MongoDB that used the shell so I was somewhat comfortable.  I had to use the `help` command and look up a lot of stuff, but I think I got the hang of at least moving around the database and looking at the data through shell queries.
