# Inventory Application

This is the repo for the Inventory Application project in the NodeJS course of The Odin Project.  Using MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS the project builds an inventory database for an imaginary store.  The app is to be able to create, read, update, and delete \(CRUD\) items and categories in the store.
